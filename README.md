## Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

Hi there! I'm EkeVoki, a Junior Programmer who believes that code is a separate, unique space for creativity.

**🙏 A special thanks** to my classmate [@Vadim-Khristenko](https://github.com/Vadim-Khristenko) for being my guide into the IT world!

**💻 Tech Stack & Interests:**
- **Main Tools:** Python
- **Currently Exploring:** Databases
- **Always Curious About:** Game development, automation scripts, and creating bots (mostly in Telegram)

**🎯 Current Focus:**
- Deep-diving into **Telegram bot development with Python**.
- Building **EkeVokiBot (name TBD)** — a tool for my needs.

**🍥 Beyond the Screen:**
When I'm not coding, you're most likely to find me watching anime, battling it out in a strategy game, or learning something new just for fun. I love connecting with people who are passionate about their craft!
